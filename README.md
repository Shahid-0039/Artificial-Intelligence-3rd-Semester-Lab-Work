# Artificial Intelligence 3rd Semester Lab Work

## Overview

This repository contains the lab work and practical assignments for the Artificial Intelligence (AI) course in the third semester. It is designed to help students gain hands-on experience with foundational AI concepts, algorithms, and programming techniques. The materials here align with a typical university AI curriculum and are intended for educational purposes, including learning, experimentation, and submission of assignments.

## Repository Structure

- **Labs and Experiments:**  
  The repository is organized into folders or files for each lab or practical assignment. Each section focuses on a different AI concept, algorithm, or technique. You may find:
  - Python code files implementing various AI algorithms.
  - Jupyter notebooks for interactive learning and experimentation.
  - Lab manuals or detailed instructions in Markdown or PDF format.
  - Data files (such as `.csv`, `.txt`, `.json`) used for experiments.
  - Result or output files generated from running code.

- **README and Documentation:**  
  Each lab folder may include its own README or instruction manual outlining the objectives, requirements, and steps for completion.

## Typical Lab Topics

The labs are based on standard AI curricula and may include topics such as:
- Problem-solving and search algorithms (e.g., BFS, DFS, A* search)
- Knowledge representation and reasoning (e.g., propositional and predicate logic)
- Basics of machine learning (e.g., supervised and unsupervised learning, k-NN, decision trees)
- Introduction to neural networks and simple deep learning models
- Fuzzy logic and genetic algorithms
- AI programming exercises, mainly in Python
